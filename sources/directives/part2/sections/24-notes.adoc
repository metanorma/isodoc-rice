== Notes

[[scls_24-1]]
=== Purpose or rationale

Notes are used for giving additional information intended to assist the understanding or use of the text of the document. The document shall be usable without the notes.

For rules on notes to figures, see <<scls_28-5-4>>.

For rules on notes to tables, see <<scls_29-5-1>>.

Notes to entry (in terminological entries) follow different rules from those for notes, see <<scls_16-5-9>>. <<table_8>> summarizes how to use notes and footnotes within documents.

[[scls_24-2]]
=== Title

Notes do not have a title.


[[scls_24-3]]
=== Numbering and subdivision

Within a given clause or subclause, notes shall be numbered sequentially. The numbering restarts at each new subdivision. A single note in a subdivision does not need to be numbered.


[[scls_24-4]]
=== Referencing

Notes do not need to be specifically referred to in the text.

If notes are referred to, use for example, the following forms for references:

* "`an explanation is provided in 7.1, Note 2`";
* "`see 8.6, Note 3`".


[[scls_24-5]]
=== Specific principles and rules

Notes shall not contain requirements (e.g. use of "`shall`", see <<table_3>>) or any information considered indispensable for the use of the document, for example instructions (imperative mood), recommendations (e.g. use of "`should`", see <<table_4>>) or permission (e.g. use of "`may`", see <<table_5>>). Notes should be written as a statement of fact.

<<table_8>> summarizes how to use notes and footnotes within documents.

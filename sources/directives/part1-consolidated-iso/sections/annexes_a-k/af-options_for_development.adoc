=== "Fast-track procedure"


[[_idTextAnchor399]]
==== {blank}

Proposals to apply the fast-track procedure may be made as follows.


[[_idTextAnchor400]]
===== {blank}

The Committee Secretariat, any P-member or category A liaison organization of a concerned technical committee or subcommittee may propose that an *existing standard from any source* be submitted for vote as an enquiry draft. The proposer shall obtain the agreement of the originating organization before making a proposal. The criteria for proposing an existing standard for the fast-track procedure are a matter for each proposer to decide.


[[_idTextAnchor401]]
===== {blank}

An international standardizing body recognized by the ISO or IEC council board may propose that a *standard developed by that body* be submitted for vote as a final draft International Standard.


[[_idTextAnchor402]]
===== {blank}

An organization having entered into a formal technical agreement with ISO or IEC may propose, in agreement with the appropriate technical committee or subcommittee, that a *draft standard developed by that organization* be submitted for vote as an enquiry draft within that technical committee or subcommittee.


[[_idTextAnchor403]]
==== {blank}

The proposal shall be received by the Chief Executive Officer, who shall take the following actions:

. settle the copyright and/or trademark situation with the organization having originated the proposed document, so that it can be freely copied and distributed to National Bodies without restriction, and advise the organization that the ISO/IEC intellectual property policies shall apply to the proposed document, see in particular <<_idTextAnchor217>> and <<_idTextAnchor219>>;

. for cases <<_idTextAnchor400>> and <<_idTextAnchor402>>, assess in consultation with the relevant secretariats which technical committee/subcommittee is competent for the subject covered by the proposed document; where no technical committee exists competent to deal with the subject of the document in question, the Chief Executive Officer shall refer the proposal to the technical management board, which may request the Chief Executive Officer to submit the document to the enquiry stage and to establish an ad hoc group to deal with matters subsequently arising;

. ascertain that there is no evident contradiction with other International Standards;

. distribute the proposed document as an enquiry draft (<<_idTextAnchor400>> and <<_idTextAnchor402>>) in accordance with <<_idTextAnchor174>>, or as a final draft International Standard (case <<_idTextAnchor401>>) in accordance with <<_idTextAnchor184>>, indicating (in cases <<_idTextAnchor400>> and <<_idTextAnchor402>>) the technical committee/subcommittee to the domain of which the proposed document belongs.


[[_idTextAnchor404]]  
==== {blank}

The period for voting and the conditions for approval shall be as specified in <<_idTextAnchor173>> for an enquiry draft and <<_idTextAnchor183>> for a final draft International Standard. In the case where no technical committee is involved, the condition for approval of a final draft International Standard is that not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative.

In ISO the voting period on a proposal submitted as a final draft International Standard shall be 20 weeks.


[[_idTextAnchor405]]  
==== {blank}

If, for an enquiry draft, the conditions of approval are met, the draft standard shall progress to the approval stage (<<_idTextAnchor183>>). If not, the proposal has failed and any further action shall be decided upon by the technical committee/subcommittee to which the document was attributed in accordance with <<_idTextAnchor403>> b).

The committee leadership can decide whether or not to skip the FDIS vote, and go straight to publication -- see <<_idTextAnchor177>>.

If, for a final draft International Standard, the conditions of approval are met, the document shall progress to the publication stage (<<_idTextAnchor193>>). If not, the proposal has failed and any further action shall be decided upon by the technical committee/subcommittee to which the FDIS was attributed in accordance with <<_idTextAnchor403>> b), or by discussion between the originating organization and the office of the CEO if no technical committee was involved.

If the standard is published, its maintenance shall be handled by the technical committee/subcommittee to which the document was attributed in accordance with <<_idTextAnchor403>> b), or, if no technical committee was involved, the approval procedure set out above shall be repeated if the originating organization decides that changes to the standard are required.

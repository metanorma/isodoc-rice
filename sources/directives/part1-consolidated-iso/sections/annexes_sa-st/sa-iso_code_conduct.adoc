The Code is to facilitate ISO's work which is carried out in an international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sector environment. It applies to people who choose to participate in an ISO committee, working group or other consensus group. The Code is an obligation for participation in the above groups that work in the framework of the ISO/IEC Directives.

== Deadlines for posting committee and working group meeting documents

[[_idTextAnchor529]]
=== Why it is important to respect these deadlines

National mirror committees need time to prepare their national positions on the various issues discussed at the meeting.


[[_idTextAnchor530]]
=== Ensuring that a document will be ready for circulation by the deadlines stipulated

This is the responsibility of the secretariat. They shall carefully consider the steps needed and leave enough time in advance of the meeting deadlines to make sure that the document is ready. For example, to discuss a DIS, the secretariat will have to start the process 7 months before the committee meeting (i.e. 2 weeks document preparation by the ISO Central Secretariat + 20 weeks for vote and translation + 6 weeks deadline before the meeting).

=== How to deal with issues that come up at the meeting for which no document was issued 6 weeks in advance

It is possible that committees make decisions on points for which no information was provided in advance of the meeting within the deadlines indicated below. In such cases, the committee leadership should ask the P-members present if they are comfortable and prepared to take such decisions in principle or if they would prefer time to consult further with other national stakeholders. The committee leaders should ensure that they are seeking to engage all P members in decisions, even if those P members that were not able to attend the meeting. A ballot can then be launched after the meeting via the ISO Committee Internal Ballot (CIB) mechanism to confirm any decisions.

=== Deadlines for sending working group documents

The ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1 state only that the agenda shall be sent out 6-weeks in advance of working group meetings. The timeframe for the circulation of other documents is to be decided by the working group members. WG convenors should ensure that their working groups take decisions on the acceptable time frame for circulating documents before meetings to ensure working group experts can be well-prepared. The minutes of WG meetings shall be circulated within 4 weeks after the WG meeting.

[[_idTextAnchor534]]
=== Time frames for circulating documents in advance of a web meeting or teleconference

Again, the principle should be that agendas and documents are circulated with enough time before any meeting in order that participants can be well-prepared for informed discussions and decisions. Web or teleconference meetings of TCs, PCs, SCs and WGs for limited aspects of their work should follow the same time frames detailed above. P-members involved should decide on appropriate timeframes for circulation of documents before Chairman's Advisory Groups, Advisory Groups, Task Forces, etc.
